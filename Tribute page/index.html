      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Muhammad Ali (1942-2016) was an influential heavyweight boxer and civil
        rights activist. Known for his dynamic boxing style and magnetic
        personality, Ali became a three-time world heavyweight champion. His
        refusal to be drafted into the Vietnam War and his outspoken advocacy
        for racial equality made him a symbol of strength and resilience.
        Despite his battle with Parkinson's disease later in life, Ali's legacy
        as "The Greatest" endures, inspiring millions with his athletic prowess
        and unwavering convictions.
